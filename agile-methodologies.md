# Agile Methodologies

#### **Different Agile Methodologies**

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Below are some of the most popular **Agile methodologies** used in software development and project management:

***

### **1. Scrum**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Software development teams needing structured sprints and frequent delivery.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Work is divided into **Sprints** (1-4 weeks).
* Roles: **Scrum Master**, **Product Owner**, and **Development Team**.
* Uses **Daily Standups (Daily Scrum)** for progress updates.
* Has a **Product Backlog** and **Sprint Backlog** for task management.
* Ends with a **Sprint Review & Retrospective** to assess outcomes.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A team developing a mobile app releases a new feature every 2 weeks via sprints.

***

### **2. Kanban**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Continuous delivery and teams with changing priorities.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Uses a **Kanban board** with columns like **To Do, In Progress, Review, Done**.
* Limits **Work in Progress (WIP)** to avoid bottlenecks.
* Focuses on **visualizing tasks** and optimizing workflow.
* No fixed iterations (unlike Scrum).

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A customer support team managing incoming tickets and ensuring fast resolutions.

***

### **3. Lean (Lean Software Development)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Focuses on **delivering value with minimal waste**.
* Emphasizes **continuous improvement** and fast feedback loops.
* Encourages **automation** and reducing unnecessary processes.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A startup streamlining development by automating code deployment and reducing unnecessary meetings.

***

### **4. Extreme Programming (XP)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Teams requiring high-quality code with frequent releases.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Encourages **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** (write tests before writing code).
* Uses **Pair Programming** (two developers work on the same code).
* Emphasizes **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Frequent Releases**.
* Prioritizes **customer collaboration** and quick adaptability.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A fintech company ensuring secure and high-quality code through TDD and frequent updates.

***

### **5. Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Large teams working on complex, feature-heavy applications.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Focuses on **designing and building features iteratively**.
* Uses **short development cycles** (2 weeks per feature).
* Encourages **domain-driven design** to align development with business needs.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A banking software team delivering features like "loan calculator" and "transaction history" separately.

***

### **6. Crystal Methodology**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Small teams that value flexibility over rigid frameworks.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Focuses on **people and interactions** rather than processes.
* Different **Crystal variants** exist (e.g., Crystal Clear for small teams, Crystal Red for large teams).
* Encourages **face-to-face communication** and lightweight documentation.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A startup team working closely together, adapting processes based on project needs rather than following strict rules.

***

### **7. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Large enterprises scaling Agile across multiple teams.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Uses **Agile Release Trains (ARTs)** to align multiple teams.
* Implements **PI Planning (Program Increment Planning)** to synchronize work.
* Combines **Scrum, Kanban, and Lean** principles.
* Focuses on **business agility** and strategic alignment.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A global e-commerce company using SAFe to manage teams across different regions and products.

***

### **8. Disciplined Agile (DA)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best For:** Organizations looking for a flexible mix of Agile practices.\
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**

* Provides a **toolkit** to choose the best Agile practices.
* Combines **Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, Lean, and DevOps**.
* Encourages **tailoring Agile methods** based on business needs.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A company switching between Scrum and Kanban depending on project requirements.
