#### **Definition of Done (DoD) in Project Management & Agile**

**ðŸ“Œ What is Definition of Done (DoD)?**

**Definition of Done (DoD)** is a **set of clear, measurable criteria** that a task, feature, or product must meet before it is considered **"done"** and ready for release. It ensures quality, completeness, and alignment with stakeholder expectations.

***

#### **ðŸ”¹ Why is DoD Important?**

âœ… Prevents misunderstandings about when work is complete.\
âœ… Ensures consistency across the team.\
âœ… Maintains **high-quality deliverables** (e.g., code quality, documentation, testing).\
âœ… Reduces technical debt by enforcing best practices.\
âœ… Helps in **release readiness** and compliance.

***

#### **ðŸ”¹ Example of Definition of Done (DoD) in Agile**

**For a User Story in Scrum**

âœ” Code is written and follows coding standards.\
âœ” Code is peer-reviewed and approved.\
âœ” Unit tests pass with 90%+ coverage.\
âœ” Feature is tested (QA passed).\
âœ” No critical bugs remain.\
âœ” Documentation is updated.\
âœ” Feature is deployed to staging or production.

**For a Feature in Software Development**

âœ” API is developed and tested.\
âœ” UI/UX is implemented as per design.\
âœ” Security and performance tests are completed.\
âœ” The feature works across supported browsers/devices.\
âœ” The feature is demoed to stakeholders.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Definition of Done vs. Definition of Ready**

| **Aspect**  | **Definition of Done (DoD)**                        | **Definition of Ready (DoR)**                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose** | Ensures work is complete & meets quality standards. | Ensures work can be started (clear scope, acceptance criteria).    |
| **Used In** | Task completion                                     | Task initiation                                                    |
| **Example** | "Code is reviewed, tested, and deployed."           | "User story has acceptance criteria, designs, and is prioritized." |

#### **ðŸ”¹ Best Practices for Defining DoD**

âœ… Keep DoD **specific, measurable, and achievable**.\
âœ… Align DoD with **business, technical, and quality standards**.\
âœ… Regularly update DoD as the project evolves.\
âœ… Ensure team members agree on DoD before starting work.
