# Prioritization Technique

#### **Prioritization Techniques in Project Management**

Prioritization is crucial for managing tasks, features, or projects efficiently. Below are some common prioritization techniques used in project management:

***

### **1. MoSCoW Method**

Used in Agile and software development to prioritize tasks based on business needs.

* **M – Must Have** → Critical features that are non-negotiable.
* **S – Should Have** → Important but not critical; can be done later.
* **C – Could Have** → Nice-to-have features that are optional.
* **W – Won't Have (for now)** → Low-priority items that may be considered in the future.

📌 _Example:_ In a mobile app development project, "Login with email" might be a **Must Have**, while "Dark mode" could be a **Could Have** feature.

***

### **2. Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix)**

A simple framework for prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance.

|                   | **Urgent**     | **Not Urgent**       |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Important**     | Do it now ✅    | Schedule it 📅       |
| **Not Important** | Delegate it 🤝 | Eliminate or Defer ❌ |

📌 _Example:_

* **Urgent & Important:** Fixing a critical bug in production.
* **Important but Not Urgent:** Planning next quarter's roadmap.
* **Urgent but Not Important:** Responding to non-critical emails (can be delegated).
* **Neither Urgent nor Important:** Attending an irrelevant meeting.

***

### **3. RICE Scoring Model**

Used for prioritizing features or projects based on impact and effort.

📌 **Formula:**\
**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort**

* **Reach:** How many people will benefit? (e.g., 1,000 users/month)
* **Impact:** What is the impact on users? (Low = 1, High = 5)
* **Confidence:** How certain are you about estimates? (e.g., 80%)
* **Effort:** How much time/resources are required? (e.g., 10 person-days)

📌 _Example:_\
If a feature has **Reach = 5000, Impact = 4, Confidence = 90%, Effort = 10**, then:\
👉 **RICE Score = (5000 × 4 × 0.9) ÷ 10 = 1800**\
Higher scores indicate higher priority!

***

### **4. Kano Model**

Helps prioritize features based on customer satisfaction.

* **Basic Needs (Must-Haves):** Features that customers expect (e.g., working checkout on an e-commerce site).
* **Performance Needs:** The better these features work, the happier customers are (e.g., faster page load time).
* **Exciters (Delighters):** Unexpected features that wow users (e.g., free shipping).

📌 _Example:_ A **chatbot for customer support** may be a **Delighter** today but could become a **Must-Have** in the future.

***

### **5. WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) – SAFe Agile Method**

Used in Agile and SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) to prioritize work based on value and effort.

📌 **Formula:**\
**WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) ÷ Job Size**

📌 _Example:_\
If a task has:

* **Business Value = 8**
* **Time Criticality = 6**
* **Risk Reduction = 4**
* **Job Size = 5**\
  👉 **WSJF Score = (8 + 6 + 4) ÷ 5 = 3.6**\
  Higher WSJF scores mean higher priority.

***

### **6. Value vs. Effort Matrix**

A simple 2x2 matrix that compares impact vs. effort:

|                | **High Effort**   | **Low Effort**            |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **High Value** | Major Projects 🚀 | Quick Wins ✅              |
| **Low Value**  | Time Wasters ❌    | Fillers (Low Priority) 📌 |

📌 _Example:_ Fixing a **critical security issue** is a **Major Project**, whereas adding a **minor UI tweak** is a **Quick Win**.

#### **Which Prioritization Technique to Use?**

| **Technique**               | **Best for...**                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **MoSCoW**                  | Feature prioritization in Agile projects          |
| **Eisenhower Matrix**       | Task prioritization based on urgency & importance |
| **RICE Model**              | Prioritizing product features & roadmap planning  |
| **Kano Model**              | Understanding customer satisfaction levels        |
| **WSJF**                    | Agile teams prioritizing work in SAFe             |
| **Value vs. Effort Matrix** | Quick decision-making for tasks & projects        |
