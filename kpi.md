# KPI

KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable value that indicates how effectively an individual, team, or organization is achieving a specific goal. Unlike OKRs, which focus on ambitious goal-setting and alignment, KPIs are primarily used to track performance and efficiency over time.

#### **Types of KPIs**

1. **Leading KPIs** â€“ Predict future performance (e.g., number of leads generated for sales).
2. **Lagging KPIs** â€“ Measure past performance (e.g., revenue growth over the last quarter).
3. **Quantitative KPIs** â€“ Numeric-based performance metrics (e.g., customer retention rate).
4. **Qualitative KPIs** â€“ Subjective or experience-based measures (e.g., customer satisfaction score).

#### **Examples of KPIs in Different Areas**

* **Project Management:** On-time delivery rate, budget variance, task completion rate
* **Software Development:** Deployment frequency, defect density, mean time to resolution (MTTR)
* **Sales & Marketing:** Conversion rate, customer acquisition cost (CAC), return on investment (ROI)
* **Customer Support:** Net Promoter Score (NPS), average resolution time

#### **KPI vs. OKR: What's the Difference?**
