# ML Training and Evaluation

**Data Splitting (Train/Validation/Test):**

* **Why it's crucial:** We split the available data into three sets to properly train and evaluate our model's ability to generalize to unseen data. If we trained and tested on the same data, the model might just memorize the specific examples and perform poorly on new data (overfitting).
* **Train Set:** The largest portion of the data (typically 70-80%). This is what the model "learns" from â€“ the data it sees during training.
* **Validation Set:** A smaller portion (10-15%). Used to tune the model's _hyperparameters_. Hyperparameters are settings that control the learning process itself (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength). We train multiple models with different hyperparameter settings on the training set and evaluate them on the validation set to choose the best performing one. This helps prevent overfitting to the _test_ set.
* **Test Set:** The final portion (10-15%). Used _only_ for the final evaluation of the trained model's performance. This gives us an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on truly new, unseen data. It's like the final exam. _Never_ train or tune on the test set.

**2. Hyperparameter Tuning:**

* **What it is:** As mentioned above, hyperparameters are settings that control the learning process, _not_ learned by the model itself. Examples include:
  * Learning rate (how quickly the model adjusts its weights)
  * Regularization strength (how much the model is penalized for complexity, which helps prevent overfitting)
  * Number of layers or neurons in a neural network
  * Depth of a decision tree
* **Why it's important:** The right hyperparameters can significantly impact model performance. Tuning them is crucial for getting the best results.
* **How it's done:** Common methods include:
  * Manual search (trying different combinations)
  * Grid search (trying all combinations within a specified range)
  * Random search (sampling combinations randomly)
  * Bayesian optimization (a more intelligent approach that uses past evaluations to guide the search)

**3. Overfitting/Underfitting:**

* **Overfitting:** The model learns the training data _too_ well, including noise and specificities. It performs great on the training data but poorly on the validation and test data. Imagine memorizing the answers to a specific test instead of understanding the underlying concepts.
* **Underfitting:** The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training and test data. Imagine trying to fit a straight line to data that clearly follows a curve.
* **How to address:**
  * **Overfitting:** Use more data, regularize the model (L1 or L2 regularization), simplify the model (fewer layers/neurons, shallower trees), use dropout (in neural networks).
  * **Underfitting:** Use a more complex model (more layers/neurons, deeper trees), add more features, reduce regularization.

**4. Performance Metrics:**

These metrics help us quantify how well our model is performing. The choice of metric depends on the specific problem.

* **Classification:**
  * **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances. (Good for balanced datasets).
  * **Precision:** Out of all the instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?
  * **Recall:** Out of all the actual positive instances, how many were correctly predicted?
  * **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. A good balance between the two.
  * **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
* **Regression:**
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of the MSE. Easier to interpret as it's in the same units as the target variable.  &#x20;
  * **R-squared:** Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.  &#x20;

**Why this is important for you as a manager:**

* **Project planning:** Understanding the model lifecycle helps you estimate timelines and resource needs for ML projects.
* **Technical discussions:** You can have more informed conversations with your team about model performance and potential improvements.
* **Communication with stakeholders:** You can explain the results of ML projects in a clear and understandable way.
* **Risk assessment:** You can identify potential problems, such as overfitting or underfitting, and take steps to mitigate them.

By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to effectively manage ML projects and guide your team towards building successful models.
